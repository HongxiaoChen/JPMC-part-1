# HNN and HMC

This repository contains code samples for the **2025 Machine Learning Center of Excellence Summer Associate** projects. Specifically, it replicates the results from the article *"Efficient Bayesian inference with latent Hamiltonian neural networks in No-U-Turn Sampling"* by **Somayajulu L.N. Dhulipala, Yifeng Che, and Michael D. Shields**.

Codes and reports for part 2 of this task are in [Pseudo-Marginal HNN HMC](https://github.com/HongxiaoChen/JPMC-part-2).

## Running Tests

To run tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and use the command line:

bash
`python -m unittest discover -v `

---

## Environment

The code is written in **Python 3.8** and requires the following libraries:

- **TensorFlow 2.10**
- **TensorFlow Probability 0.18.0**

## Replication Materials

The main code files are stored in the **`codes/`** directory under the root directory. Below is a description of the key files in the repository:

### Core Files
- **`functions.py`**: Contains Hamiltonian functions used in the study.
- **`utils.py`**: Implements leapfrog algorithms and other frequently used utility functions.
- **`get_args.py`**: Stores the parameters used in the replication project.
- **`nn_models.py`**: Generates Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs).
- **`hnn.py`**: Packages the MLPs from `nn_models.py` and generates Latent Hamiltonian Neural Networks (L-HNNs).

### Training and Sampling
- **`train_hnn.py`**: Script to train the models.
- **`hnn_hmc.py`**: Performs L-HNN Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
- **`traditional_hmc.py`**: Implements traditional HMC.
- **`hnn_nuts_test.py`**: Performs both L-HNN No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) and traditional NUTS.

### Scripts for Replication
Run the following scripts to replicate the respective results presented in Dhulipala (2023):

- **`Figure2.py`**
- **`Figure3.py`**
- **`Figure4_5_6.py`**
- **`Table1.py`**
- **`Figure7_table2.py`**
- **`Figure8_table3.py`**
- **`Figure9_table3.py`**
- **`Figure10_table3.py`**
- **`Figure11_table4.py`**
- **`Figure12_table4.py`**

### Other Folders
- **`files/`**: Stores weights of networks and generated data.
- **`logs/`**: Contains logs generated during execution.
- **`figures/`**: Saves the generated figures.

## Testing

Unit tests are written in **`unittest`** and stored in the **`tests/`** folder under the root directory. Below is a detailed breakdown of the test files and their purposes:

- **`test_utils.py`**: Tests utility functions in `utils.py`.
- **`test_hnn_utils.py`**: Tests utility functions from `utils.py` and their integration with the Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) framework.
- **`test_data.py`**: Tests data generation functions from the data module, specifically `get_trajectory` and `get_dataset`.
- **`test_functions.py`**: Tests mathematical operations implemented in `functions.py`.
- **`test_traditional_hmc.py`**: Tests the implementation of the `TraditionalHMC` class for performing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling.
- **`test_hnn_hmc.py`**: Tests the implementation of the `HNNSampler` class, which combines Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling.
- **`test_hnn_nuts.py`**: Tests the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) implementation integrated with Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN).
